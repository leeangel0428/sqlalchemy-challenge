# Introduction
Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 10 aka the sqlalchemy-challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 10's challenge on SQLAlchemy. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview
In this specific challenge, I was challenged to treat myself to a long holiday vacation. To help with that, I was to analyze the climate in Honolulu, Hawaii. The first part of my challenge was to analyze and explore the climate data from the two csv files using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I had to find out: "Which station id had the greatest number of observations?" Spoiler alert! It was 'USC00519281'. The second part of my challenge was to design a Flask API based on the queries developed.

# Additional Information/Citations
In this repository, you will find the SurfsUp folder containing the completed jupyter notebook code titled "climate_starter.ipynb" and the python file containing the code designing the Flask API. There is also a folder within SurfsUp titled "Resources" where the 2 csv files of data and the hawaii sqlite file are. Aside from the sources cited below to help refresh my python memory and solve errors, everything used was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
